# K-Art Neural Network for Predicting Defect Diffusion in Nickel (Ni)

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for a project that combines K-Art (Kinetically Accelerated Atomistic Monte Carlo) simulation technique with neural networks to predict the diffusion of defects in Nickel (Ni). The aim is to provide a comprehensive tool for researchers and engineers to understand and predict defect diffusion behavior in Ni-based materials, aiding in materials design and engineering.

## Features
- Integration of K-Art simulation technique for accurate atomistic modeling.
- Utilization of neural networks for efficient prediction of defect diffusion behavior.
- Comprehensive dataset for training and evaluation.
- Modular and extensible codebase for easy customization and integration into other projects.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow, K-Art, Matplotlib, etc. (requirements specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Install dependencies:
